# CRUD_Web_Application_JavaEE
<h3>My favorite project. It's big fully CRUD web application with Front-End and Back-End that works on localhost Tomcat server and connected to MySQL database.</h3>
<p>When you start the application you will see user-friendly Front-End interface and "Sign Up / Log In" page on witch you can register an account or log in your existing profile. If your data will be wrong or invalid, you will see relevant message. All data stored in local MySQL database.</p>
<p>When you succesfully loged in your account, you will be redirect to your Profile Page where you can see: 
 <ul>
  <li>Your avatar (chosen randomly among 3 variants)</li>
  <li>Username</li>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Age (if you enter it on "Edit profile" page)</li>
  <li>Field "About" where you can describe you</li>
  <li>Video that describe you (paste URL of video <strong>FROM YOUTUBE</strong> in field on "Edit profile" page)</li>
  <li>"Edit Profile" button</li>
  <li>"Log Out" button</li> 
 </ul>
    </p>
    
<p>After clicking on "Edit Profile" button you will see page where you can see all your data and also change any of them, except your avatar. As I say, the avatar sets automatically).</p>
<p>Even if you close this app or close the browser, you can open the again page with an app and you will see your profile page immediately! It's becouse of application create and store cookies that contain your ciphered data to log in when you sign up or log in to your account. But if you click "Log Out", you will be redirected to the home page (Sign Up / Login) and your cookies will be deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Well, that's it. I'm so proud of myself and happy because it's my first that big and challenging project to me. I've spent a bit more than a month to complete this and during this time I learn a lot of new things and features. It was an exciting experience, but It's only the beginning, I want something much bigger!</strong></p>
